<h3 class="minititle">Chapter 1 The Escape</h3> 
<article>
                
<P>Whandon J. Kindley the faceless writer of "Papelos", a realistic fiction about a boy who is accused of committing multiple murders and is getting away from the FBI, has just recently been invited to a conference to create a show for his book with the company Hackville Publishers. He heads up to the conference room on the third floor. When he enters the room he describes his setting as a bland room with a large window and a fold-able table with five white men in business suits sitting at it and a muscular, black man standing over them and an over all sketchy vibe.
         Whandon was greeted with a hello and an obviously fake smile which didn't help with the sketchy vibe he gotten from this situation but nonetheless he ignored it for the time being. He took his seat and said,"Shall we began men." He was answered with "Ah a business man I see, well I'm Jason Hackville these are my supervisors Dunce" he waves,"Reganles" he smiles again, "Kimberly" he stares angrily at Hackville, "and Jack." he showed little to no reaction. Whandon looks up at the large black man standing above them. Hackville noticing this and says, "Oh, pay no attention to him. He is here so in case you aren't the friendliest person." Whandon gave a nod and started, "Well is there anything we need to discuss about my," Hackville rudely interrupted, "Our!" Whandon resumed,"Is there anything we need to discuss about OUR show?" Hackville answered, "Yes, actually there is. Well you see when you wrote this I think you didn't think about visuals so you wrote this on a serious note, but when you add in visuals it needs more of a comedic mood so we are asking  if you will allow us to." It was Whandon turn to interrupt he with, "No." Hackville replied with a very intimidating face, "Sorry, but what did you say?" "No, I don't want it have anything to do with comedy." "Ok, ok I understand this" Hackville said looking like he was calming himself,"but please Whandon..." Again Whandon interrupted but this time he was ordering him with an intense tone,"Don't call me Whandon you address me as Kindley!"

         <p> After that threat, Hackville looked like he was ready to murder Whandon and he planned to. Suddenly, Hackville snapped his fingers and the large black man started to move around the desk to Whandon, but Whandon had other plans almost  instantly he jumped on the desk and barreled toward the window. Before Whandon could make to the window, he was grabbed by the large man. The large man proceeded to pound his face in like a punching bag. Whandon using his weight wrecking balled through the window bringing the large man with him. He then put the man in front of him, and the man took most the fall. The man was either dead or on the verge of death for he had multiple glass pieces stuck in him and bleeding all over before. Whandon took off he thought 'If only he had not worked for that man.' He took off toward his car and drove away leaving Hackville and his subordinates dumbfounded, expect Kimberly and Jack.

<h3 class="minititle" >The Retry</h3> 
        <p> After driving for what felt like hours he had parked his car and processed to check his surroundings. He noticed he was at some kind of beach and it was packed there was probably hundreds of teenagers with about twenty-four adults. He looked over to his left and noticed a lot of buses. He assumed it was some kind of field-trip for a school. Now that he was sure he was safe broke into dance out of his luck of finding a beach and escaping Hackville. While he was dancing some of the teens noticed he was pretty good and there happened to be an empty tub next to him ,so they started dropping money in and chanting. This kept going for about thirty minutes and the circle around  his was pretty large, Heck, even some of the teachers joined them tired and a little hungry he had stopped and said,"alright, alright I'm done." Almost all in unison they sighed, "Aw!" He jokey replied,"What I am human,we all get tired sometimes." The children laughed, smiled, and bid farewell thinking they would never see the man again but they soon would. Whandon counted the money he had collected, which was $14. He went to the nearest place that happened to be a Taco Bell. There he ordered a crunchy taco supreme and a Mountain Dew Baja Blast, which left him with about $10. He sat there for a while contemplating on his next move. He had a couple ideas option one heed back to city and continue his life, but that was instantly knocked  as Hackville was probably roaming with cops after him.
